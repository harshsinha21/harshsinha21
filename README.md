### This is information about myself including my bio and resume ðŸ‘‹

All parts of the assignment are completed and validated. I was able to implement the photo,
and the links to the bio and resume on the index. 

This lab took a lot of time to edit and tweak. The entire process from learning to application 
was approximately 6-8hours. The longest part being the resume structure.

This was a very engaging lab, I will aim to spend more time on the next one for better results.

I did not include a real biography or real photo.
